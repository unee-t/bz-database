# IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT THIS SCRIPT	#
#											#
#############################################
#
# Built for BZFE database v2.17 to v2.19
#
# This script adds an existing BZ user to an existing case which has already been created.
# We use this when:
#	- The user is invited to a role in a unit for a case that already been created
#
# When this happens we need to:
#	- Add the user to the list of user in that role for the unit
#	  This is done with the scripts
#		- 3_replace_dummy_role_with_genuine_user_as_default_in_unee-t_bzfe_v2.x.sql
#		OR
#		- 4_add_an_existing_bz_user_to_a_role_in_an_existing_unit_bzfe_v2.x.sql
#
#
# Use this script only if 
#	- the Unit/Product ALREADY EXISTS in the BZFE
#	- the BZ user ALREADY has an assigned role in that unit (does NOT need to be the default assignee for the role).
#	- The table 'ut_data_to_add_user_to_a_case' has been updated and we know the record that we need to use to do the update.
#
# Limits of this script:
#	- DO NOT USE if the unit DOES NOT exists in the BZ database.
#	- DO NOT USE if the role DOES NOT exists in the BZ database for that unit.
#	- DO NOT USE if the role created is assigned to a 'dummy' BZ user.
#	- DO NOT USE if the BZ User has NO role in that unit.
